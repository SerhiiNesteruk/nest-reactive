# nest-reactive
This project demonstrates how to build [nest](https://developer.nest.com/) application using [akka-streams](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/2.0.2/scala.html) library

To run app you have to get nest token and update `src/main/resources/props.txt`
After that execute the command `sbt runMain com.ns.Main`
